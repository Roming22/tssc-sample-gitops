# Gitops Repo Patterns

This repository contains a set of gitops repository format components for use with the RHTAP tssc-sample-templates.
An integration with PoC CLI for maintaining is optional. 

# Usage

To use these templates, create an RHTAP app using Developer hub and it will be included as part of the gitops deployment.


# PoC CLI

A CLI for viewing and editing these templates is provided here https://github.com/jduimovich/tad-bootstrap
